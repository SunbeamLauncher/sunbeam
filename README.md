Sunbeam is a command-line launcher, inspired by [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf), [raycast](https://raycast.com) and [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum).

It allows you to build interactives UIs from simple scripts.

## Why sunbeam?

I love TUIs, but I spent way to much time writing them.

I used a lot of application launchers, but all of them had some limitations.

Sunbeam try to address these limitations:

### Sunbeam runs on all platforms

Sunbeam is written is distributed as a single binary, so you can run it on any platform. The sunbeam extension system is also designed to be cross-platform.

### Sunbeam is language agnostic

Sunbeam communicates with your scripts using JSON, so you can use any language you want.
The only requirement is that the script is executable and outputs a JSON object conforming to the Sunbeam JSON Schema on stdout.

### Sunbeam supports custom clients

Sunbeam comes with a built-in TUI to interact with your scripts, but you can also use any other client.

Currently the only alternative client is [sunbeam-raycast](https://github.com/pomdtr/sunbeam-raycast).

## Inspirations / Alternatives

Sunbeam wouldn't exist without taking inspirations from incredible tools. Make sure to checkout:

- [raycast](https://raycast.com): Sunbeam shamelessly copy most of raycast UX. Even the project name is a reference to raycast.
- [fzf](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf): Sunbeam tries to take inspiration from fzf, but it's not a drop-in replacement. Sunbeam is designed to be used as a launcher, not as a fuzzy finder.
- [gum](https://github.com/charmbracelet/gum): Sunbeam is powered by charm libraries, and can be seen as a alternative spin on gum. Gum is invoked by scripts, while sunbeam invokes scripts.
- [slapdash](https://slapdash.com): The sunbeam event loop was inspired by slapdash. Sadly, slapdash doesn't seem to be updated anymore.
