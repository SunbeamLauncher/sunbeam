## Managing Extensions

A fresh install of sunbeam is pretty boring. In order to make it useful, you need to add some extensions.

You can manage your extensions using the `sunbeam extension` command.
To get a list of available extensions, run `sunbeam extension browse` command.
It will open the [extension registry](https://github.com/topics/sunbeam-extension) in your browser.

Once you find an extension you like, you can install it using the `sunbeam extension install <url>` command.

> ⚠️ Extensions are not verified, nor sandboxed. They can do anything you can do on your computer. Make sure you trust the source before installing an extension.

For example, let's install the Devdocs extension:

```sh
sunbeam extension install https://github.com/pomdtr/sunbeam-devdocs
```

Now, you can run `sunbeam devdocs` to open the devdocs extension, and search for documentation in your terminal.

Use `enter` to select a docset, then type to search for a specific entry, and press `enter` again to open it in your browser.
Or, if you just want to copy the entry url, press `tab` to show the list of actions, and select `copy url`.

If you regularly use a specific docset, you can skip the docset selection view by using `sunbeam devdocs list-entries --slug go` for example.
Use `sunbeam devdocs --help` to get a list of available commands.

Other managements commands are available:

- sunbeam extension list: list installed extensions
- sunbeam extension remove: uninstall an extension
    - ex: `sunbeam extension remove devdocs`
- sunbeam extension rename: rename an extension
    - ex: `sunbeam extension rename devdocs dd`
- sunbeam extension upgrade: upgrade an extension
    - ex: `sunbeam extension upgrade devdocs` or `sunbeam extension upgrade --all`

## Root Commands

By default, if you run sunbeam without any arguments, it will show an usage message.

```

If you want to show a list of commands instead, you need to set them in the config file, located at `~/.config/sunbeam/config.json` by default (you can set the `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` env var to override this).

```json
{
    // the key is the root item title, and the value is the command to run
    "root": {
        "Search DevDocs Docsets": "sunbeam devdocs",
        "Search Go Documentation": "sunbeam devdocs list-entries --slug go"
    }
}
```
